STEP-BY-STEP COMMANDS TO RUN You're currently in: C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull> FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY: STEP 1: Navigate to the project folder Copy and paste this command into your command prompt: cd /d "c:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" Press: ENTER You should see: c:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system> STEP 2: Install dependencies (one time only) Copy and paste this command: pip install flask flask-cors numpy Press: ENTER Wait for it to say "Successfully installed" (takes 1-2 minutes) STEP 3: Start the Backend Server Copy and paste this command: python life_backend_server.py Press: ENTER You should see something like: Backend server running on http://localhost:5000 Ready to receive EEG data... ️ DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW - Keep it running in the background STEP 4: Open a SECOND command prompt window Press: Windows Key + R Type: cmd Press: ENTER A new command prompt window opens STEP 5: Navigate to the same folder in the second window In the NEW command prompt window, copy and paste: cd /d "c:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" Press: ENTER STEP 6: Start the HTTP Server In the SECOND window, copy and paste: python -m http.server 8080 Press: ENTER You should see: Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ... ️ DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW - Keep it running in the background STEP 7: Open your web browser Open Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or any browser In the address bar, type: http://localhost:8080/LIFE_AI_PLATFORM_REAL.html Press: ENTER STEP 8: Verify the page loaded You should see a page with: - Title: "L.I.F.E AI" - Subtitle: "Real Artificial Intelligence & Neural Network Optimization Platform" - Status indicator at top (either GREEN or YELLOW) If you see YELLOW: Wait 5 more seconds for backend to connect STEP 9: Test the integration 1. Close any popup that appears (click OK button) 2. Look for tabs at the top of the page. Click the tab labeled: "EEG AI Integration" (It should be a cyan/teal colored button) 3. On that page, click the button: "Process EEG AI Integration" (It should be a blue button) 4. WAIT 2-5 SECONDS 5. You should see results appear that say: L.I.F.E REAL Algorithm Processing Complete! Analysis Results (REAL_ALGORITHM): • EEG Quality: 75.2% • Neural Engagement: 82.5% • Learning Readiness: 88.3% • Cognitive Load: 45.1% • Attention Score: 79.8% • Adaptability: 72.4% If you see "REAL_ALGORITHM" in the results → SUCCESS! If nothing happened after 5 seconds: - Check Terminal 1 (backend) - is it still running? Any errors? - Check Terminal 2 (HTTP) - is it still running? Any errors? - Check browser console - press F12, click "Console" tab, are there errors? Share a screenshot of: 1. The browser page (what you see) 2. Terminal 1 (backend window) 3. Terminal 2 (HTTP server window) And I'll help fix it!
