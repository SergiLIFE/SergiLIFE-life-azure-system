You're done! STILL SEEING "localhost refused to connect"? This means the HTTP server didn't start in STEP 7. FIX: 1. Go back to the SECOND cmd window (from STEP 5) 2. Check if it shows an error 3. If error is "port 8080 already in use": Type: python -m http.server 9000 Press: Enter Then open browser to: http://localhost:9000/LIFE_AI_PLATFORM_REAL.html 4.
