HOW IT WORKS: 4-PHASE SYSTEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PHASE 1: MONITORING
  User Calls Function (e.g., showTab())
         |
         V
  Algorithm Records:
    - Function name
    - Platform name
    - Execution start time
    - Function parameters
    - User/session ID
         |
         V
  Function Executes
         |
         V
  Algorithm Records Completion:
    - Execution end time
    - Success/failure status
    - Return value
    - Error messages (if any)
    - Resources used

PHASE 2: LEARNING
  Algorithm Analyzes:
    - Success rate trend
    - Performance trend
    - Error patterns
    - Cross-function dependencies
    - Resource consumption
         |
         V
  Pattern Recognition:
    "showTab() fails 50% of the time"
    "Failures happen when switching rapidly"
    "Failures correlate with high EEG load"
    "Success rate improving over time"

PHASE 3: OPTIMIZATION
  Algorithm Generates:
    - Priority fixes (critical failures)
    - Performance improvements (slow functions)
    - Reliability enhancements (unstable functions)
    - Resource optimizations (heavy functions)
    - Recommendations for developers

PHASE 4: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
  Each New Execution:
    - Updates success metrics
    - Refines performance baselines
    - Improves failure predictions
    - Adjusts optimization recommendations
    - Gets smarter over time

CROSS-PLATFORM INSIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The algorithm learns ACROSS platforms:

FINDING 1: Navigation Function Issues
  Enterprise Platform:   showTab() = 50% success
  Education Platform:    showTab() = 100% success
  Clinical Platform:     showTab() = 100% success
  
  Root Cause Analysis:
    Enterprise uses onclick="showTab()"
    Others use addEventListener()
    
  Solution: Standardize event handling across all platforms

FINDING 2: EEG Connection Performance
  Enterprise: connectCorporateEEG() = 1,200ms
  Clinical:   connectPatientEEG() = 900ms
  Education:  connectStudentEEG() = 850ms
  
  Learning: Enterprise version has extra validation
  Optimization: Apply Clinical platform's faster approach

FINDING 3: Analytics Function Scalability
  Small dataset (1,000 records):   200ms
  Medium dataset (100,000 records): 1,200ms
  Large dataset (1M+ records):     3,500ms+ (TIMEOUT)
