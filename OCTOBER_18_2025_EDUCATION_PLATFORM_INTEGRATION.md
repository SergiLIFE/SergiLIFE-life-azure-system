**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Platform:** LIFE_EDUCATION_PLATFORM_REAL.html  
**Version:** 2025.1.0-EDUCATION-AUTONOMOUS

## Integration Complete

### What Was Done:

#### 1. Real L.I.F.E Theory Algorithm Integration
Complete integration of experimentP2L algorithm into the education platform:

**EQUATION 1: Trait Modulation (Line 6427)**
```javascript
dT = adaptation_rate * EEG_engagement * (1 + env_weight * env_factor)
```
Calculates how student traits adapt based on engagement and environment.

**EQUATION 2: Neuroplasticity Growth (Line 6446)**
```javascript
Growth = base_rate * (1 - current_level/saturation) * experience * log(1 + time)
```
Models how neuroplasticity develops over time with learning experience.

**EQUATION 3: Quantum Trait Projection (Line 6476)**
```javascript
|ψ⟩ = Σ(αᵢ * |trait_i⟩) with coherence = 0.85
```
Quantum-inspired projection of student learning traits.
