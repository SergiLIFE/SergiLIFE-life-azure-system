## 📊 **Current Question: Microsoft Graph Integration**

### **Question:** Does your SaaS offer integrate with Microsoft Graph?

### **Recommended Answer for L.I.F.E Platform:**

**✅ SELECT: "Yes, my SaaS offer integrates with Microsoft Graph"**

### **Why This Is Correct:**

   - JIT (Just-In-Time) access implementation requires Graph API
   - Enterprise user management through Azure AD

2. **Azure Integration:**
   - Your platform runs on Azure Functions
   - Uses Azure Key Vault for secrets management
   - Integrates with Azure Monitor for logging

3. **Business Benefits:**
   - ✅ **Better discovery** in Microsoft Marketplace
   - ✅ **Simplified deployment** via Microsoft 365 admin center
   - ✅ **Enterprise customer appeal** (Graph integration = professional)

## 🚀 **Graph API Permissions You Should Request**

### **Basic Permissions (Recommended):**
- `User.Read` - Read user profile information
- `User.ReadBasic.All` - Read basic profiles of all users
- `Directory.Read.All` - Read directory data (for enterprise features)

### **Advanced Permissions (Enterprise Features):**
- `Group.Read.All` - Read group information
- `Application.ReadWrite.All` - Manage applications (for JIT)
- `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` - Read role assignments

## 💡 **If You Don't Have Graph Integration Yet**

### **Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)**
Create a basic Azure AD app registration now:
1. Just for marketplace certification
2. Can enhance later with full Graph integration
3. Gets your offer approved faster

### **Option 2: Select "No" for Now**
- **Pro:** Faster completion of marketplace offer
- **Con:** Less enterprise appeal and discovery
- **Con:** Can't use Microsoft 365 admin center deployment

### **Option 3: Enhanced Integration (Future)**
Plan to add full Graph integration:
- User authentication via Microsoft accounts
- Enterprise directory synchronization
- Teams integration for learning collaboration
- Office add-ins for learning analytics
