# Microsoft 365 Integration Configuration Guide ## **Current Question: Microsoft Graph Integration** ### **Question:** Does your SaaS offer integrate with Microsoft Graph? ### **Recommended Answer for L.I.F.E Platform:** ** SELECT: "Yes, my SaaS offer integrates with Microsoft Graph"** ### **Why This Is Correct:** 1. **Enterprise Security Features:** - Your platform uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication - JIT (Just-In-Time) access implementation requires Graph API - Enterprise user management through Azure AD 2. **Azure Integration:** - Your platform runs on Azure Functions - Uses Azure Key Vault for secrets management - Integrates with Azure Monitor for logging 3. **Business Benefits:** - **Better discovery** in Microsoft Marketplace - **Simplified deployment** via Microsoft 365 admin center - **Enterprise customer appeal** (Graph integration = professional) --- ## **Microsoft Entra Identity App ID** ### **You Need to Provide:** Your Azure AD Application (Client) ID for Graph API integration. ### **How to Find Your App ID:** 1. **Azure Portal Method:** ``` 1. Go to portal.azure.com 2. Navigate to: Azure Active Directory → App registrations 3. Find your L.I.F.E Platform app registration 4. Copy the "Application (client) ID" ``` 2. **If You Don't Have One Yet:** ``` 1. Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations → New registration 2. Name: "L.I.F.E Platform - Neuroadaptive Learning" 3. Account types: "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts" 4. Copy the generated Application (client) ID ``` ### **Format Example:** ``` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``` --- ## **Graph API Permissions You Should Request** ### **Basic Permissions (Recommended):** - `User.Read` - Read user profile information - `User.ReadBasic.All` - Read basic profiles of all users - `Directory.Read.All` - Read directory data (for enterprise features) ### **Advanced Permissions (Enterprise Features):** - `Group.Read.All` - Read group information - `Application.ReadWrite.All` - Manage applications (for JIT) - `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` - Read role assignments --- ## **If You Don't Have Graph Integration Yet** ### **Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)** Create a basic Azure AD app registration now: 1. Just for marketplace certification 2. Can enhance later with full Graph integration 3. Gets your offer approved faster ### **Option 2: Select "No" for Now** - **Pro:** Faster completion of marketplace offer - **Con:** Less enterprise appeal and discovery - **Con:** Can't use Microsoft 365 admin center deployment ### **Option 3: Enhanced Integration (Future)** Plan to add full Graph integration: - User authentication via Microsoft accounts - Enterprise directory synchronization - Teams integration for learning collaboration - Office add-ins for learning analytics --- ## **Quick Azure AD App Setup** ### **Create App Registration Now:** 1. **Login to Azure Portal:** - Use: `sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com` - Go to: Azure Active Directory → App registrations 2. **Create New Registration:** ``` Name: L.I.F.E Platform - Neuroadaptive Learning System Account types: Multitenant + personal accounts Redirect URI: https://lifecoach-121.com/auth/callback ``` 3. **Configure API Permissions:** - Add: Microsoft Graph → Delegated permissions - Select: User.Read, User.ReadBasic.All - Grant admin consent 4. **Copy Application ID:** - Save the generated GUID for marketplace form --- ## **Marketplace Impact** ### **With Graph Integration (Recommended):** - **Enterprise positioning** - Professional Microsoft integration - **Better discovery** - Appears in Microsoft 365 searches - **Simplified deployment** - IT admins can deploy easily - **Higher pricing justification** - Enterprise integration premium ### **Without Graph Integration:** - ️ **Consumer positioning** - Standalone SaaS only - ️ **Manual discovery** - Customers must find you directly - ️ **Complex deployment** - Manual setup required - ️ **Lower pricing power** - Less enterprise value --- ## **Recommended Action Plan** ### **For Immediate Launch:** 1. **Quick Setup (30 minutes):** - Create Azure AD app registration - Get Application ID - Select "Yes" on marketplace form - Enter the Application ID 2. **Future Enhancement:** - Implement full Graph API integration - Add Teams collaboration features - Build Office add-ins for analytics - Enhance enterprise directory sync ### **Marketplace Form Completion:** ``` Question: Does your SaaS offer integrate with Microsoft Graph?
