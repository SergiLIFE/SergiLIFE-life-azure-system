# L.I.F.E. Platform — Product Information & Support

**Last updated:** October 7, 2025

## Platform overview

The L.I.F.E. (Learning Individually from Experience) Platform delivers a neuroadaptive learning environment that processes real-time EEG signals to personalize training content for university labs, clinical researchers, and enterprise learning teams. The solution combines the Venturi Gates architecture with Microsoft Azure services to achieve sub-millisecond neural response analysis, secure data handling, and full auditability for regulatory review.

### Core capabilities

- Real-time EEG ingestion, artifact filtering, and neural state detection
- Adaptive learning orchestration powered by the LIFEAlgorithmCore engine
- Azure-native deployment with automated scaling, monitoring, and compliance logging
- Evidence export for academic validation and governance workflows
- Autonomous campaign and KPI tracking modules to support institutional rollout

## Getting started

1. Request onboarding by contacting our success team at [success@lifecoach-121.com](mailto:success@lifecoach-121.com).
2. Receive secured access credentials, Azure tenant configuration, and sandbox EEG datasets.
3. Run the automated deployment validation script to verify connectivity with your Azure subscription.
4. Launch production workloads or connect your live EEG acquisition devices following the integration guide supplied during onboarding.

## Pricing tiers

- **Basic ($15/user/month):** Entry-level neuroadaptive learning with EEG playback and core analytics.
- **Professional ($30/user/month):** Adds real-time adaptive sequencing, KPI dashboards, and extended storage.
- **Enterprise ($50/user/month):** Full Venturi Gates orchestration, custom compliance reporting, SLAs, and dedicated Azure resource governance.

Volume discounts and academic licensing are available upon request.

## Support channels

- **Email:** [support@lifecoach-121.com](mailto:support@lifecoach-121.com)
- **24/7 Incident Desk:** +1 (877) 555-1210 (North America) | +34 93 555 1210 (EMEA)
- **Status page:** [https://status.lifecoach-121.com](https://status.lifecoach-121.com)
- **Knowledge base:** Accessible via in-app Help → Documentation.

During the September 2025 launch window, our incident desk operates with elevated staffing to guarantee sub-15-minute acknowledgement times for Severity A tickets.

## SLA commitments

- **Uptime:** 99.9% monthly availability backed by Azure regional redundancy in East US 2.
- **Response times:**
  - Sev A — Learning disruption or EEG data loss: 15-minute acknowledgement, 2-hour workaround.
  - Sev B — Degraded analytics or delayed exports: 1-hour acknowledgement, 6-hour resolution target.
  - Sev C — General inquiries and feature requests: Same-business-day acknowledgement, prioritised in next sprint planning.

## Compliance and data handling

- All EEG data in transit is encrypted with TLS 1.3; at rest it is stored in Azure Blob Storage with customer-managed keys (CMK) via Azure Key Vault.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) aligns with institutional policies and FERPA/GDPR requirements.
- Detailed audit logs are retained for a minimum of 400 days and exportable in CSV/JSON formats for institutional review.
- Refer to the [L.I.F.E. privacy policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/main/docs/privacy.md) for comprehensive data usage details.

## Escalation path

1. Create a ticket through the in-app Help Center or email [support@lifecoach-121.com](mailto:support@lifecoach-121.com) with "Sev A" in the subject for critical issues.
2. If no response within SLA targets, call the incident desk and provide your subscription ID and Product ID `0578b800-18d9-477e-8e87-0e01ab642e38`.
3. For unresolved matters beyond 24 hours, escalation reaches the Azure Customer Success liaison and L.I.F.E. executive sponsor.

## Customer success resources

- **Onboarding workshops:** Weekly live sessions covering EEG calibration and adaptive course authoring.
- **Certification readiness:** Templates and checklists for institutional ethics boards and IRB submissions.
- **Venturi architecture labs:** Guided simulations demonstrating low-latency neural processing pipelines.
