> production launch. Can you help escalate this to Severity B (24x7) and assign a 
> dedicated support engineer? The issue is: 'Unable to login due to authenticator blockage' 
> affecting both Azure Portal and Partner Center access."

---

### **October 9-10 (ISV Manager Meeting - 9 AM GMT):** 🚀

**Meeting Agenda Item #1: Ticket Escalation**

**What to Say:**
1. "I raised support ticket `2510060050004304` on October 6"
2. "Current severity is C, but this is blocking our October 28 launch"
3. "Can you help escalate to Severity B and get a dedicated engineer?"
4. "The issue is authenticator blockage preventing Azure Portal access"

**What to Ask:**
- "What's the fastest path to resolution?"
- "Can you assign a specific support engineer?"
- "Can we get 24x7 support given launch criticality?"
- "Should I create a new Azure account as backup?"

**Expected Outcome:**
- ISV Manager escalates ticket internally
- Severity upgraded to B (24x7 support)
- Dedicated engineer assigned within 24 hours
- Resolution timeline: 3-5 days (by October 14)

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE: "Authenticator Blockage"**

**What This Likely Means:**
- Microsoft Authenticator app issue
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) problem
- Azure AD authentication configuration issue
- Account permission/role assignment issue

**Possible Quick Fixes (Microsoft May Suggest):**
1. Remove and re-add account in Authenticator app
2. Use backup authentication method (SMS, email code)
3. Reset MFA settings through Microsoft Account recovery
4. Temporarily disable MFA to regain access
5. Create new Microsoft account if account-level corruption

**You Don't Need to Troubleshoot:**
- Support engineer will diagnose
- They have backend tools to fix authentication
- ISV Manager can expedite the process
