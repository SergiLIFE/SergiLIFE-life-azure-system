## üÜò **IMMEDIATE DATA RECOVERY ACTIONS**

### **Step 1: STOP ALL OPERATIONS**
- Do NOT run any more Azure commands until we assess damage
- Keep your system running but avoid file operations
- Document what files you remember being affected

### **Step 2: USB DRIVE RECOVERY**
Let me check your USB drive status:

**Safe Commands to Run:**
```cmd
# Check USB drives
wmic logicaldisk get size,freespace,caption
dir D:\ /s > usb_inventory.txt
dir E:\ /s > usb_inventory2.txt
```

### **Step 3: Important Files Assessment**
**TELL ME IMMEDIATELY:**
1. What specific important files have disappeared?
2. Were they on your main drive (C:) or USB?
3. When did you last see them (before/after the Logic App bug)?
4. Are they L.I.F.E Platform files or personal documents?

### **Step 4: Windows System Recovery**
```cmd
# Check for shadow copies (Windows backup)
vssadmin list shadows
# Check recycle bin
dir C:\$Recycle.Bin /s /a
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE PROTECTIVE MEASURES**

xcopy "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" "C:\EMERGENCY_BACKUP_%DATE%" /E /H /Y
```

### **2. System State Assessment**
