## 🎯 **CHAT SHARING BEST PRACTICES**

### **Timing Strategy:**
- **Post initial link** at meeting start (5 minutes in)
- **Repost during transitions** between demo sections
- **Share again** before hands-on exploration
- **Final reminder** during Q&A

### **Message Format:**
- **Keep it short** - Teams chat has limited space
- **Use emojis** for quick visual scanning
- **Include context** - what they should try
- **Add reassurance** - GDPR compliance, safety

### **Interactive Elements:**
- **Encourage participation**: "Try the device testing!"
- **Ask for feedback**: "What do you see in the neural waves?"
- **Guide exploration**: "Click on the EEG frequency bands"
- **Support in real-time**: "Having trouble? Let me know!"

## 📱 **TEAMS CHAT ADVANTAGES**

### **Why Chat Sharing Works Perfectly:**
✅ **Clickable links** - one-click access for attendees
✅ **Persistent access** - link stays visible throughout meeting
✅ **Individual exploration** - everyone at their own pace
✅ **Real-time support** - instant help via chat
✅ **Documentation** - meeting transcript includes links
✅ **Mobile friendly** - works on phones/tablets too

### **Multiple Access Methods Simultaneously:**
