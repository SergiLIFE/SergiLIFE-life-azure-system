"Dr. Sarah Chen teaches Biology 101 to 30 students with EEG headsets. Platform monitors attention in real-time, adjusts quiz difficulty, suggests breaks when class engagement drops. Post-session report shows John struggled with mitochondria (94% engagement) while Emma excelled at cell membrane (89% engagement). Auto-exports to Canvas LMS. **Result: 23% higher test scores.**"

### **Healthcare: Clinical Neuropsychologist**
"Dr. Michael Torres treats TBI patient with cognitive rehabilitation. Platform adapts therapy every 0.42ms based on brain state, reduces difficulty when cognitive load exceeds 85%. Session shows 12% memory improvement, 8 minutes longer attention vs. baseline. Export to Epic EMR (HIPAA compliant). **Result: 34% faster recovery.**"

### **Enterprise: Training Manager**
"Jennifer Park trains 500 factory workers on safety protocols.
