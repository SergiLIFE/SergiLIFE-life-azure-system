# Azure Marketplace Campaign Setup Guide This guide will help you configure the GitHub repository secrets and activate your Azure Marketplace campaign automation. ## Required GitHub Repository Secrets ### **Step 1: Navigate to Repository Settings** 1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system` 2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** 3. Click **New repository secret** for each secret below ### **Step 2: Add Required Secrets** #### **Azure Integration Secrets** ```bash # Core Azure secrets (you likely already have these) AZURE_CREDENTIALS # Azure service principal credentials AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID # Your Azure subscription ID AZURE_CLIENT_ID # Azure app registration client ID AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET # Azure app registration client secret AZURE_TENANT_ID # Your Azure tenant ID ``` #### **Marketplace Campaign Secrets** (NEW - Add These) ```bash # Partner Center API integration PARTNER_CENTER_TOKEN # Partner Center API token MARKETPLACE_OFFER_ID # 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb (already configured) # Campaign automation CAMPAIGN_API_KEY # Campaign automation API key (optional) OUTREACH_API_TOKEN # Email/outreach automation token (optional) ``` #### **Azure Resource Secrets** ```bash # Staging environment AZURE_RG_STAGING # life-platform-staging-rg AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME_STAGING # life-platform-staging # Production environment AZURE_RG_PRODUCTION # life-platform-rg AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME_PRODUCTION # life-platform-prod AZURE_LOCATION # eastus2 ``` ## Partner Center Token Setup ### **Option 1: Use Existing Azure AD App** If you already have Azure AD app registration: ```powershell # Get your existing app details az ad app list --display-name "your-app-name" --query "[0].{appId:appId,objectId:id}" # Create client secret for Partner Center API az ad app credential reset --id <your-app-id> --append ``` ### **Option 2: Create New Partner Center Integration** ```powershell # Create new app registration for Partner Center az ad app create --display-name "life-platform-partner-center" \ --sign-in-audience "AzureADMyOrg" # Create service principal az ad sp create --id <app-id-from-above> # Create client secret az ad app credential reset --id <app-id> --append ``` **Important**: Save the client secret value immediately - it won't be shown again. ## Campaign Activation Instructions ### **Method 1: GitHub Actions UI (Recommended)** 1.
