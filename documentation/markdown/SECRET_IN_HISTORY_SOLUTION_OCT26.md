# Secret in Git History - Push Protection Block - October 26, 2025 ## Current Issue **Error:** GitHub Push Protection is blocking your push **Reason:** Azure AD App Secret detected in git history **File:** `SUCCESS_AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CREATED.md` **Commit:** `01a599b59655772d9a3b1278c9a20fd099aba022` **Location:** Line 30 contains `clientSecret` ## Why This Happened Even though you may have edited or removed the secret from the current version of the file, **git keeps full history**. The secret exists in an older commit (01a599b59), and GitHub Push Protection scans the entire commit history, not just the current files. ## Solution Options ### Option 1: Quick Fix - Use Bypass URL (Recommended) GitHub provides a bypass URL for this specific secret. If you're confident this secret is no longer active or has been rotated: **Click this link and allow the secret:** ``` https://github.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34bTVeHgOI3WcVxj0IGkVGenpwu ``` Then push again: ```cmd git push origin main --force ``` ### Option 2: Complete Fix - Remove from History If you want to completely remove the secret from git history: **Run the automated script:** ```cmd FIX_SECRET_IN_HISTORY_OCT26.bat ``` This will: 1. Remove `SUCCESS_AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CREATED.md` from git tracking 2. Add it to `.gitignore` 3. Amend your last commit 4. Force push to override history **Or manually:** ```cmd git rm --cached SUCCESS_AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CREATED.md echo SUCCESS_AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CREATED.md >> .gitignore git add .gitignore git commit --amend -m "Fix: Remove Azure secrets from tracking" git push origin main --force ``` ### Option 3: Rotate the Secret If the secret is still active and you're concerned about security: 1. **Rotate the secret in Azure:** ```cmd az ad sp credential reset --id a02fdbdf-7b2a-42ba-ba8c-a98c399df02a ``` 2. **Update GitHub Secrets** with new credentials 3. **Then use Option 1 or 2** to push your code ## Recommended Approach **For fastest resolution:** Use **Option 1** (bypass URL) - The secret in history is from Oct 22, 2025 - You likely already have it stored securely in GitHub Secrets - Bypass is safe if secret is rotated or you control access **For maximum security:** Use **Option 3** then **Option 2** - Rotate secret first - Then remove from history - Most secure but takes longer ## Files Affected The following files contain secrets and should NEVER be committed: - `SUCCESS_AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CREATED.md` - Contains clientSecret - `LIVE_FUNCTION_TESTING_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` - Contains Azure Function Keys - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS_UPDATE_GUIDE_OCT26.md` - Safe (secrets redacted) - `GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIX_COMPLETE_OCT26.md` - Safe (secrets redacted) ## Prevention for Future Updated `.gitignore` to include: ```gitignore SUCCESS_AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CREATED.md LIVE_FUNCTION_TESTING_SUCCESS_REPORT.md *_CREDENTIALS.md *_SECRET*.md *.secret ``` ## After Fixing Once you've resolved the secret issue using any of the options above: 1. Your pending changes will push successfully 2. GitHub Actions will run 3. The React build error is a separate issue (optional fix with `FIX_REACT_BUILD_ERROR.py`) ## ℹ️ Important Notes - **Git history is permanent** - removing from current files doesn't remove from history - **GitHub Push Protection** scans entire history, not just current state - **Force push** is required to rewrite history after removing secrets - **Bypass URLs** expire after 7 days if not used --- **Created:** October 26, 2025 **Issue:** GitHub Push Protection - Azure AD App Secret **Status:** Awaiting resolution via Option 1, 2, or 3 **Impact:** Blocking all pushes to main branch
