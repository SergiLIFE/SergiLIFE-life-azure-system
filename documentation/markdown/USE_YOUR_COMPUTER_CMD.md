# USE YOUR COMPUTER CMD - NOT VS CODE TERMINAL Since VS Code terminal isn't working, use your computer's CMD directly. Here's exactly how: --- ## STEP 1: Open Command Prompt on Your Computer ### **Windows 10/11:** 1. Click **Windows Start Button** (bottom left) 2. Type: `cmd` 3. Press **Enter** ### **OR Press These Keys:** - **Windows Key + R** - Type: `cmd` - Press **Enter** ### **You should see:** ``` C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull> ``` **CMD is now open!** --- ## STEP 2: Copy This Entire Command ```cmd cd "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" && python -m http.server 8080 ``` --- ## STEP 3: Paste Into CMD 1. In CMD window, right-click 2. Click **Paste** 3. Press **Enter** ### **You should see:** ``` Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ... ``` **Server is running!** --- ## STEP 4: Open Browser **Open ANY web browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.) and go to: ``` http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html ``` ### **You should see:** - L.I.F.E Platform loads - Blue header - Dashboard with metrics - All buttons clickable **PLATFORM IS RUNNING!** --- ## Try Other Platforms Once you have the server running, you can click any of these: ``` http://localhost:8080/L.I.F.E_PLATFORM_ULTIMATE_INTEGRATED.html http://localhost:8080/LIFE_AI_PLATFORM_REAL.html http://localhost:8080/LIFE_ENTERPRISE_PLATFORM_REAL.html http://localhost:8080/LIFE_EDUCATION_PLATFORM_REAL.html http://localhost:8080/LIFE_RESEARCH_PLATFORM_REAL.html ``` --- ## To Stop the Server In CMD window, press: **Ctrl + C** ``` C:\Users\...\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system>Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ... ^C Keyboard interrupt received, exiting. ``` Server stopped! --- ## If Something Doesn't Work ### **Error: "python not found"** Try this instead: ```cmd cd "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" && python3 -m http.server 8080 ``` ### **Error: "Port 8080 already in use"** Use a different port: ```cmd cd "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" && python -m http.server 8081 ``` Then access: `http://localhost:8081/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html` ### **Nothing loads in browser** 1. Make sure CMD shows: `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080` 2. Try refreshing browser: `F5` or `Ctrl + R` 3. Try different platform link from list above 4. Check your internet connection --- ## COMPLETE CHECKLIST - [ ] CMD window open - [ ] Command pasted and running - [ ] See "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080" - [ ] Browser opened - [ ] Pasted URL: `http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html` - [ ] Platform loaded - [ ] Can click buttons and tabs **All checked? You're done!** --- ## NEXT STEPS ### **Test WITHOUT EEG (Right now):** - Server is running - Platform loads - Everything works - **Done!** ### **Test WITH EEG (If available):** 1. Open **ANOTHER** CMD window (keep first one running) 2. Run: ```cmd cd "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system" && python life_eeg_server.py ``` 3. Go back to first CMD window and platform is still running 4. Open same URL - now with real EEG data! --- ## YOU'RE READY! **Your setup:** - Using CMD on your computer - Not using VS Code terminal - All platforms accessible - No VS Code required **Just follow the steps above and you'll have all platforms running!** --- ## SUMMARY | Step | Action | |------|--------| | 1 | Open CMD (Windows Key + R → cmd → Enter) | | 2 | Copy the command from STEP 2 | | 3 | Right-click CMD → Paste | | 4 | Press Enter | | 5 | Wait for "Serving HTTP" message | | 6 | Open browser to: `http://localhost:8080/[platform].html` | | **DONE** | **Platform is running!** | --- **Need help?
