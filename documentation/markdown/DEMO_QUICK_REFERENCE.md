Demo Complete! Follow-up resources coming soon Interested in collaboration? Let's connect! ``` ## TROUBLESHOOTING ### Dashboard Won't Load: 1. Check if `LIFE_CLINICAL_GRADE_DASHBOARD.html` exists 2. Verify server is running (look for "Server started successfully!") 3. Try alternative URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080` 4. Restart demo launcher ### Server Won't Start: 1. Close any programs using port 8080 2. Try different port: `.\teams_clinical_demo_server.ps1 -Port 8081` 3. Run as Administrator if needed 4. Check Windows Firewall settings ### PowerShell Blocked: 1. Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator" 2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` 3. Confirm with 'Y' 4. Try launching again ## EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN If all servers fail, use this simple Python server: ```cmd python -m http.server 8080 ``` Then navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_GRADE_DASHBOARD.html` ## POST-DEMO ACTIONS 1. **Immediate (Same Day):** - Send thank you emails using templates - Save contact information of interested colleagues - Schedule follow-up meetings 2. **This Week:** - Send detailed collaboration proposals - Prepare customized demonstrations - Research funding opportunities 3. **This Month:** - Execute collaboration agreements - Begin joint research planning - Implement feedback improvements ## SUCCESS METRICS Demo is successful if you achieve: - [ ] All 23 colleagues see working dashboard - [ ] AI assistant responds to questions - [ ] At least 5 colleagues request follow-up - [ ] Charts and exports work properly - [ ] No major technical issues during presentation ## FILE REFERENCE **Essential Files:** - `LIFE_CLINICAL_GRADE_DASHBOARD.html` - Main dashboard - `LAUNCH_CLINICAL_DEMO.bat` - Quick launcher - `teams_clinical_demo_server.ps1` - Server script - `teams_chat_templates.txt` - Ready-to-copy messages - `professional_email_templates.md` - Follow-up emails **Optional Files:** - `test_clinical_dashboard.py` - Feature validation - `LAUNCH_CLINICAL_DEMO.ps1` - PowerShell launcher --- ## OCTOBER 15, 2025 - YOU'VE GOT THIS!
