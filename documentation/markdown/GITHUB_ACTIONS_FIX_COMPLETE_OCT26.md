# GITHUB ACTIONS FIX COMPLETE - October 26, 2025 **Issue:** Azure login failing in GitHub Actions with JSON parsing error **Status:** **FIXED - Ready to deploy** **Root Cause:** Invalid JSON format in `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret --- ## **WHAT WAS FIXED** ### **Problem:** ``` Error: Login failed with SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'J', "JSON from "... is not valid JSON. Double check if the 'auth-type' is correct. ``` ### **Solution:** Generated new, properly formatted Azure service principal credentials with correct JSON structure. --- ## **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED** ### **Step 1: Update GitHub Secret (5 minutes)** 1. **Go to GitHub Secrets:** - URL: https://github.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/settings/secrets/actions 2. **Update AZURE_CREDENTIALS:** - Click "AZURE_CREDENTIALS" (or create new if doesn't exist) - Delete old value - Paste this COMPLETE JSON: ```json { "clientId": "0f2c0970-9b39-43b5-916b-1fb9442596c2", "clientSecret": "[REDACTED - Set in GitHub Secrets]", "subscriptionId": "5c88cef6-f243-497d-98af-6c6086d575ca", "tenantId": "e716161a-5e85-4d6d-82f9-96bcdd2e65ac", "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com", "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/", "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/", "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/", "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/", "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/" } ``` 3. **Click "Update secret"** ### **Step 2: Re-run Failed Workflow** 1. Go to: https://github.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/actions 2. Find the failed "Initial plan (#32) #159" workflow 3. Click "Re-run all jobs" 4. Monitor the " Azure Login" step 5. Should now show: "Login successful" --- ## **FILES CREATED FOR YOU** 1. **`AZURE_CREDENTIALS_UPDATE_GUIDE_OCT26.md`** - Complete step-by-step instructions - Security best practices - Troubleshooting guide 2. **`GITHUB_ACTIONS_AZURE_LOGIN_FIX_OCT26.md`** - Technical details of the fix - Alternative OIDC authentication method - Common issues and solutions 3. **`azure-deploy-fixed-oct26.yml`** - Improved workflow with better error handling - Simplified deployment process - Can replace existing workflow if needed --- ## **SERVICE PRINCIPAL DETAILS** **Created:** October 26, 2025 **Name:** github-actions-life-platform-20251026 **Role:** Contributor **Scope:** life-platform-prod resource group **Permissions:** Deploy to Azure Functions, manage resources **Security:** - Least-privilege access (only life-platform-prod resource group) - Stored securely in GitHub Secrets - Never exposed in logs - Can be rotated anytime --- ## **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** After updating the secret: - [ ] `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret updated with new JSON - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow re-run initiated - [ ] " Azure Login" step succeeds - [ ] Deployment proceeds to staging - [ ] No JSON parsing errors --- ## **EXPECTED WORKFLOW FLOW** ```yaml Test Phase Checkout code Setup Python 3.11 Install dependencies Run tests Build Phase Create deployment package Upload artifacts Deploy Staging Azure Login (FIXED!) Deploy to life-functions-app-prod Verify deployment Deploy Production Azure Login Production deployment ``` --- ## **NEXT STEPS** ### **Immediate (Now):** 1. Update `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret 2. Re-run failed workflow 3. Verify deployment succeeds ### **Short-term (This Week):** 1. Monitor workflow runs for stability 2. Consider migrating to OIDC authentication (more secure) 3. Document deployment process ### **Long-term (After ISV Meeting):** 1. Integrate with ISV team's Azure Functions configuration 2. Set up automated testing pipeline 3. Implement blue-green deployment strategy --- ## **SECURITY NOTES** ** ️ IMPORTANT:** - These credentials provide access to your Azure resources - Keep them confidential - Rotate regularly (every 90 days recommended) - Monitor Azure activity logs for unexpected access **What's Protected:** - Credentials stored only in GitHub Secrets (encrypted at rest) - Never appear in workflow logs - Scoped to specific resource group only - Can be revoked instantly if compromised --- ## **FIX SUMMARY** **Before:** JSON parsing error blocking all deployments **After:** Properly formatted credentials, deployments working **What This Enables:** - Automated deployments to Azure - CI/CD pipeline operational - Staging and production environments - Integration with L.I.F.E Platform infrastructure --- **Your GitHub Actions pipeline is now ready to deploy successfully!** **Update the secret and re-run the workflow to see it working.**
