## 📋 Detailed Analysis

### Equation 1: Trait Modulation

**Purpose**: Modulate learning traits based on EEG engagement and environmental factors

**Test Case**:
- Input: engagement=0.75, focus=0.82, stress=0.35
- Environmental weight: 0.3
- Environmental factor: (0.82 + 0.65) / 2 = 0.735

**Calculation**:
```
dT = 0.15 * 0.75 * (1 + 0.3 * 0.735)
dT = 0.1125 * 1.2205
dT = 0.137306 ✓
```

**Validation**: ✅ Equation correctly implemented

---

### Equation 2: Neuroplasticity Growth

**Purpose**: Calculate learning growth with saturation model

**Test Case**:
- Current level: 50.0
- Saturation: 100.0
- Experience: 0.75 * 0.82 = 0.615
- Time factor: log(1 + 10) = 2.397895

**Calculation**:
```
Growth = 0.05 * (1 - 50/100) * 0.615 * 2.397895
Growth = 0.05 * 0.5 * 0.615 * 2.397895
Growth = 0.036868 ✓
```

**Validation**: ✅ Equation correctly implemented with saturation

---

### Equation 3: Quantum Projection

**Purpose**: Project multiple learning traits into coherent quantum state

**Test Case**:
- 5 traits: engagement=0.75, focus=0.82, creativity=0.65, analytical=0.72, relaxation=0.65
- Total: 3.59
- Normalized traits: engagement=0.209, focus=0.228, creativity=0.181, analytical=0.201, relaxation=0.181

**Calculation**:
```
Coherence = 0.209² + 0.228² + 0.181² + 0.201² + 0.181²
Coherence = 0.0437 + 0.0520 + 0.0328 + 0.0404 + 0.0328
Coherence = 0.2017 ✓
