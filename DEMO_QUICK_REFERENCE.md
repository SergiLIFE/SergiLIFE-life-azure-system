## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Dashboard Won't Load:
1. Check if `LIFE_CLINICAL_GRADE_DASHBOARD.html` exists
2. Verify server is running (look for "Server started successfully!")
3. Try alternative URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
4. Restart demo launcher

### Server Won't Start:
1. Close any programs using port 8080
2. Try different port: `.\teams_clinical_demo_server.ps1 -Port 8081`
3. Run as Administrator if needed
4. Check Windows Firewall settings

### PowerShell Blocked:
1. Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Confirm with 'Y'
4. Try launching again

## üìû EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN

If all servers fail, use this simple Python server:
```cmd
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_GRADE_DASHBOARD.html`

## üìß POST-DEMO ACTIONS

1. **Immediate (Same Day):**
