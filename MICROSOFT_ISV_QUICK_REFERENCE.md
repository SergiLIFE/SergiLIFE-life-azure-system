## üé§ ANSWERS TO LIKELY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### "How do you process EEG data so fast?"
**Answer:** "Proprietary Venturi Gates System - inspired by fluid dynamics principles. Three-gate orchestrator (INPUT, PROCESSING, OUTPUT) with parallel async processing in Azure Functions. We extract 5 frequency bands (delta through gamma) and calculate coherence, attention, and learning efficiency in sub-millisecond time."

### "What about data security and compliance?"
**Answer:** "Enterprise-grade security built-in:
- Azure AD authentication with SSO
- Key Vault for all secrets (no stored credentials)
- Encrypted at rest (Blob Storage) and in transit (TLS)
- GDPR compliant, UK Data Protection Act 2018
- Healthcare roadmap includes HIPAA for US market (2026)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for enterprise customers"

### "How do you validate accuracy?"
**Answer:** "Multiple validation methods:
1. **100-cycle synthetic test suite** (proprietary EEG generation) - 95.8% accuracy
2. **PhysioNet BCI Competition IV-2a dataset** (real-world EEG) - 78-82% accuracy
3. **SOTA benchmarks** comparing to traditional LMS, AI tutors, research systems
4. **Pilot programs** with real institutions (Q4 2025) for production validation

All results logged and reproducible - full testing suite in `production_deployment_test.py`."

### "What's your scaling plan?"
**Answer:** "Phased approach:
- **Now:** Single-region (East US 2), supports 1,000 concurrent users
- **Q1 2026:** Multi-region (West Europe), CDN integration
- **Q2 2026:** Database replication, auto-scaling based on demand
- **2027:** Global presence across all Azure regions, processing 100,000+ concurrent users

Cost model: Azure Functions serverless = pay only for actual processing, Blob Storage = cold tier for historical data. Very efficient for our usage patterns."

### "How will you integrate with existing systems?"
**Answer:** "2026 integration roadmap:
- **LMS:** Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard (LTI standard)
- **EHR:** Epic, Cerner via FHIR APIs
- **HRIS:** Workday, SAP SuccessFactors
- **Hardware:** Emotiv, OpenBCI, NeuroSky EEG devices
