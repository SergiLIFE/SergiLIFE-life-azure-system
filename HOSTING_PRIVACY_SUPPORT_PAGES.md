# How to Host Privacy Policy & Support Pages on GitHub

## âœ… **QUICK SOLUTION: Use GitHub Raw URLs (Works Immediately)**

Your privacy policy and support pages are now in your repository. You can use these URLs **RIGHT NOW** in Partner Center:

### **Privacy Policy URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/main/docs/privacy-policy.md
```

### **Support URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/main/docs/support.md
```

**These URLs work IMMEDIATELY after you commit and push to GitHub!**

## ðŸš€ **BETTER SOLUTION: Enable GitHub Pages (5 minutes)**

For prettier URLs like `https://sergilife.github.io/privacy`:

### **Step 1: Push These Files to GitHub**

```cmd
cd "c:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system"
git add docs/privacy-policy.md docs/support.md
git commit -m "Add privacy policy and support pages for Azure Marketplace"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages**

1. Go to: https://github.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Under "Branch", select: **"main"** and **"/docs"**
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### **Step 3: Your New URLs Will Be:**

```
https://sergilife.github.io/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/privacy-policy
https://sergilife.github.io/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system/support
```
