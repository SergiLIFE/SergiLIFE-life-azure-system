TESTING SCENARIOS - BASIC PLAN --------------------------------- • Open Main Platform URL (L.I.F.E_PLATFORM_COMPLETE_WITH_TABS.html) • Navigate through all available tabs • Test Neural Processing Dashboard functionality • Run "100-Cycle EEG Test" simulation (takes ~2 minutes) • Verify real-time metrics display in local environment • Test campaign automation (safe mode enabled for demo) 3. TESTING SCENARIOS - PROFESSIONAL PLAN ---------------------------------------- • Access Clinical Platform (LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html) • Test Advanced Analytics Dashboard • Run "SOTA Benchmark Test" simulation (takes ~5 minutes) • Verify multi-tenant isolation in demo mode • Test professional-grade features and interfaces 4. TESTING SCENARIOS - ENTERPRISE PLAN -------------------------------------- • Access Enterprise Platform (LIFE_ENTERPRISE_PLATFORM_REAL.html) • Test complete Platform Suite functionality • Verify all neural processing algorithms work in demo mode • Test campaign management system interface • Verify real-time EEG processing simulations 5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (LOCAL TESTING) ----------------------------------------- • Browser: Chrome/Edge (latest version recommended) • JavaScript: Must be enabled for platform functionality • Local File Access: Browser must allow local file:/// URLs • No Network Required: All platforms work offline during certification • Cookies/Storage: Local storage enabled for session management 6. EXPECTED TEST RESULTS ------------------------ • All platform files load within 3 seconds locally • Neural processing simulations complete without errors • All dashboards display simulated real-time data • Campaign system shows "DEMO MODE" banners throughout • No console errors in browser developer tools • All platform variants demonstrate full functionality 7. DEMO DATA & SAFETY LIMITATIONS --------------------------------- • All EEG data is simulated for safety/privacy compliance • Campaign system operates in demonstration mode only • No real Azure charges incurred during local testing • All processing results are safe demonstration data • No personal/medical data is collected, processed, or stored • Platforms work independently without cloud dependencies 8. SUPPORT CONTACT & TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ----------------------------------------- • Technical Support: sergio.paya.borrull@outlook.com • Platform Status: All local systems operational as of Oct 27, 2025 • Response Time: Within 4 hours during business hours (CET) • Cloud Deployment: Pending technical team authorization 9. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE ------------------------ • If platform doesn't load: Ensure browser allows local file access • If features don't work: Enable JavaScript in browser settings • If simulations fail: Try different browser (Chrome recommended) • For console errors: Press F12 and check for JavaScript errors • File not found: Verify file paths match exactly as provided above 10. COMPLIANCE & SECURITY (LOCAL OPERATION) ------------------------------------------- • Platform operates entirely in local environment during certification • GDPR compliant design (no data collection in demo mode) • No PHI/PII processed or stored during local testing • All connections remain local (no external network access required) • Session management handled locally in browser storage • Cloud deployment security will be handled by technical teams 11. POST-CERTIFICATION DEPLOYMENT --------------------------------- • Current Status: Local demonstration files ready for certification • Cloud Deployment: Awaiting technical team authorization • Azure Integration: Will be activated post-certification approval • Live URL Migration: Scheduled after marketplace approval • Customer Access: Will transition to cloud URLs upon technical clearance =================================================================================== IMPORTANT: These local file URLs are for certification testing only. Production deployment will use cloud URLs once technical teams complete authorization.
