## üö® **PREVIOUS CRASH ANALYSIS**

Based on your report that a previous Logic App fix attempt crashed, I'm implementing a **safe, systematic approach** to identify and fix the issue without system instability.

## üîç **STEP 1: SAFE DIAGNOSTIC MODE**

Let me first identify the Logic App configuration safely:

### **Current Logic App Architecture:**
Based on your system files, you have a Logic App that:
- Triggers scheduled backups (2:00 AM UTC)
- Connects to Azure Functions (`life-functions-app`)
- Manages automated workflows for L.I.F.E Platform

### **Potential Bug Locations:**
1. **Schedule Configuration** - Timer trigger issues
2. **Function App Connection** - HTTP connector problems  
3. **Authentication** - Managed identity or key issues
4. **Workflow Definition** - JSON syntax or logic errors
5. **Resource Dependencies** - Missing connections or permissions

## üõ°Ô∏è **STEP 2: SAFE INVESTIGATION COMMANDS**

Let's run **read-only** commands first to diagnose without making changes:

### **Command 1: List Logic Apps (Safe)**
```bash
az logic workflow list --resource-group life-platform-prod --output table
```

### **Command 2: Check Logic App Status (Safe)**
```bash
az logic workflow show --resource-group life-platform-prod --name [LOGIC_APP_NAME] --query "{name:name,state:state,location:location}" --output table
```

### **Command 3: View Recent Run History (Safe)**
```bash
az logic workflow run list --resource-group life-platform-prod --workflow-name [LOGIC_APP_NAME] --top 5 --output table
```
