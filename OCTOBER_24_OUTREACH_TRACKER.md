Hi [Name],

Just following up on my email about our neuroadaptive learning platform on Azure Marketplace.

Many institutions are seeing 22.66x performance improvements with our EEG-based learning system.

Would a 10-minute call this week work to show you the platform?

Best regards,
Sergio Paya Borrull

## 💡 **OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

### **When Prospects Respond:**
1. **Respond FAST** (within 2 hours if possible)
2. **Be flexible** with demo scheduling
3. **Focus on their specific needs** (education/healthcare/research)
4. **Send calendar invite immediately** after they agree to demo
5. **Follow up** if they don't join the scheduled demo

### **If Low Response Rate:**
1. **Check email deliverability** - are emails going to spam?
2. **Try different subject lines** in follow-ups
3. **Use LinkedIn** for secondary outreach
4. **Call directly** for VIP prospects (top 5)

## 📈 **PIPELINE FORECAST**

**Conservative Estimate (Based on 30% response rate):**
- 7 responses → 3 demos → 1 customer = £200K+

**Optimistic Estimate (Based on 50% response rate):**
- 12 responses → 6 demos → 2 customers = £500K+

**Best Case Scenario:**
- Microsoft partnership secured = £2.5M deal alone
