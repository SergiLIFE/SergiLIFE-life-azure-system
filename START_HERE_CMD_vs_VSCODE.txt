# YOUR TWO OPTIONS - SIDE BY SIDE ``` RUN PLATFORMS: CMD vs VS CODE OPTION A: FROM YOUR COMPUTER CMD (Standalone) PROS: • Fastest to start • No VS Code needed • Clear, simple output • Easy troubleshooting CONS: • Another window open • No code editing nearby • Need to alt+tab STEPS: 1. Windows Key + R 2. Type: cmd 3. Paste this: cd C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system && python -m http.server 8080 4. Open browser: http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html ️ TIME: 30 seconds OPTION B: FROM VS CODE INTEGRATED TERMINAL (Built-in) PROS: • Everything in one window • Code + terminal side-by-side • No extra windows • Professional setup CONS: • Slightly less visible output • One more click STEPS: 1. Open VS Code (or focus it) 2. Press: Ctrl + ` (backtick) 3. Paste this: cd C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system && python -m http.server 8080 4. Open browser: http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html ️ TIME: 45 seconds COMPARISON TABLE: Aspect CMD VS Code Terminal Setup time 30 sec 45 sec Visibility Excellent Good Multitasking Medium Excellent Troubleshooting Easy Medium Professional Standard Advanced Best for Quick test Development Code editing No Yes RECOMMENDATION: For TODAY (Quick Testing): → Use CMD (Option A) For ONGOING Development: → Use VS Code Terminal (Option B) BOTH WORK IDENTICALLY! ``` --- ## SWITCHING BETWEEN OPTIONS ### **Using CMD Right Now?** 1. Keep CMD running 2. Can easily switch to VS Code later 3. No conflict ### **Using VS Code Terminal?** 1. Server runs in background 2. Can edit code while server is running 3. Close terminal to stop server ### **Want BOTH?** 1. Start CMD in one monitor 2. Start VS Code in another 3. Both run simultaneously 4. Easy to manage --- ## DECISION TREE ``` Do you want to: Test RIGHT NOW quickly? Use CMD (Option A) Keep working on code while testing? Use VS Code Terminal (Option B) Test AND edit simultaneously? Use BOTH (split screen) Do multi-user testing? Open 2-3 of each ``` --- ## I'LL RECOMMEND: START WITH CMD **Because:** - Fastest to get results - Clearest to see what's happening - No complexity - Can switch to VS Code later **Command (Copy & Paste):** ```cmd cd C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system && python -m http.server 8080 ``` **Then:** `http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html` --- ## QUICK START ### **Right Now (Using CMD):** 1. **Open CMD:** - Windows Key + R - Type: `cmd` - Click OK 2. **Run this (copy & paste):** ```cmd cd C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system && python -m http.server 8080 ``` 3. **Open browser:** ``` http://localhost:8080/LIFE_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_CAMBRIDGE.html ``` 4. **See platform load** **Total:** 30 seconds --- ## YOU'RE READY! Pick Option A or B above and start testing NOW! All platforms work the same from either location. **Questions? See: `HOW_TO_RUN_PLATFORMS.md`**
