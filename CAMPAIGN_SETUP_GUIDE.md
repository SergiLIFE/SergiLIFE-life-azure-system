# 🚀 Azure Marketplace Campaign Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure the GitHub repository secrets and activate your Azure Marketplace campaign automation.

## 📋 Required GitHub Repository Secrets

### **Step 1: Navigate to Repository Settings**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/SergiLIFE/SergiLIFE-life-azure-system`
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret** for each secret below

### **Step 2: Add Required Secrets**

#### **Azure Integration Secrets**
```bash
# Core Azure secrets (you likely already have these)
AZURE_CREDENTIALS          # Azure service principal credentials
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID      # Your Azure subscription ID
AZURE_CLIENT_ID           # Azure app registration client ID
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET       # Azure app registration client secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID           # Your Azure tenant ID
```

#### **Marketplace Campaign Secrets** (NEW - Add These)
```bash
# Partner Center API integration
PARTNER_CENTER_TOKEN      # Partner Center API token
MARKETPLACE_OFFER_ID      # 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb (already configured)

# Campaign automation
CAMPAIGN_API_KEY          # Campaign automation API key (optional)
OUTREACH_API_TOKEN        # Email/outreach automation token (optional)
```

#### **Azure Resource Secrets**
```bash
# Staging environment
AZURE_RG_STAGING          # life-platform-staging-rg
AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME_STAGING # life-platform-staging

# Production environment  
AZURE_RG_PRODUCTION       # life-platform-rg
AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME_PRODUCTION # life-platform-prod
AZURE_LOCATION            # eastus2
```

## 🏢 Partner Center Token Setup

### **Option 1: Use Existing Azure AD App**
If you already have Azure AD app registration:

```powershell
# Get your existing app details
az ad app list --display-name "your-app-name" --query "[0].{appId:appId,objectId:id}"

# Create client secret for Partner Center API
az ad app credential reset --id <your-app-id> --append
```

### **Option 2: Create New Partner Center Integration**
```powershell
# Create new app registration for Partner Center
az ad app create --display-name "life-platform-partner-center" \
  --sign-in-audience "AzureADMyOrg"

# Create service principal
az ad sp create --id <app-id-from-above>

# Create client secret
az ad app credential reset --id <app-id> --append
```

**Important**: Save the client secret value immediately - it won't be shown again.
