# Technical Configuration - SaaS Integration URLs ## **Current Technical Configuration** **Section:** LIFE Coach 121 Professional | Technical Configuration ### **Current URLs (Azure Container Apps):** - **Landing Page:** `https://life-app-ozjafmtimm6os.bravepond-4b4b0778.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/marketplace/landing` - **Connection Webhook:** `https://life-app-ozjafmtimm6os.bravepond-4b4b0778.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/marketplace/webhook` - **Microsoft Entra Tenant ID:** `ec3bf5ff-5304-4ac8-aec4-4dc38538251e` - **Microsoft Entra Application ID:** `42ac6047-6219-4a88-8073-dcc6e11d8b0b` --- ## **Analysis: Your Current Setup** ### ** What's Working:** - **Azure Container Apps deployment** - Modern, scalable hosting - **Proper URL structure** - `/marketplace/landing` and `/webhook` endpoints - **Different Entra Application ID** - `42ac6047-6219-4a88-8073-dcc6e11d8b0b` (different from Graph API one) - **Different Tenant ID** - `ec3bf5ff-5304-4ac8-aec4-4dc38538251e` (different from your main tenant) ### ** Questions to Consider:** 1. **Are these Azure Container Apps still running?** 2. **Do you prefer to use your main domain** (`lifecoach-121.com`)? 3. **Should we align the Tenant ID** with your main tenant (`e716161a-5e85-4d6d-82f9-96bcdd2e65ac`)? --- ## **Recommended Updates** ### **Option 1: Keep Azure Container Apps (If Still Running)** **Pros:** Already configured, professional Azure hosting **Cons:** Complex URLs, different tenant **Keep current URLs if:** - Your Azure Container Apps are still deployed and running - The marketplace endpoints are functional - You prefer the Azure Container Apps architecture ### **Option 2: Update to Your Main Domain (Professional)** ``` Landing Page URL: https://lifecoach-121.com/marketplace/landing Connection Webhook: https://lifecoach-121.com/marketplace/webhook Microsoft Entra Tenant ID: e716161a-5e85-4d6d-82f9-96bcdd2e65ac Microsoft Entra Application ID: 80b95267-64a9-49b0-926c-289ed8b3312f ``` **Pros:** Clean domain, aligned with your main Azure AD, consistent branding **Cons:** Need to implement the endpoints ### **Option 3: Use Azure Functions (Your Production Setup)** ``` Landing Page URL: https://life-functions-app.azurewebsites.net/marketplace/landing Connection Webhook: https://life-functions-app.azurewebsites.net/marketplace/webhook Microsoft Entra Tenant ID: e716161a-5e85-4d6d-82f9-96bcdd2e65ac Microsoft Entra Application ID: 80b95267-64a9-49b0-926c-289ed8b3312f ``` --- ## **What These URLs Do** ### **Landing Page URL:** - **Purpose:** Where customers go after purchasing from Azure Marketplace - **Function:** Customer onboarding, account setup, welcome experience - **Must:** Handle SaaS fulfillment API integration ### **Connection Webhook:** - **Purpose:** Microsoft calls this when subscription changes occur - **Function:** Purchase notifications, cancellations, upgrades - **Must:** Handle SaaS fulfillment API webhooks ### **Microsoft Entra IDs:** - **Tenant ID:** Your Azure AD directory identifier - **Application ID:** The app registration for SaaS fulfillment (different from Graph API app) --- ## **My Recommendation: Option 2 (Clean Domain)** ### **Update to:** ``` Landing Page URL: https://lifecoach-121.com/marketplace/landing Connection Webhook: https://lifecoach-121.com/marketplace/webhook Microsoft Entra Tenant ID: e716161a-5e85-4d6d-82f9-96bcdd2e65ac Microsoft Entra Application ID: 80b95267-64a9-49b0-926c-289ed8b3312f ``` ### **Why This Is Best:** **Professional branding** - Uses your clean domain **Consistent identity** - Matches your main Azure AD tenant **Unified application** - Uses your "Sergi Paya" app registration **Customer trust** - lifecoach-121.com looks more professional than long Azure URL **Future flexibility** - Easy to implement endpoints later --- ## **Important Considerations** ### **Before Changing URLs:** 1. **Test current URLs** - Do they still work? 2. **Check Azure Container Apps** - Are they still deployed? 3. **Verify functionality** - Can customers access the landing page? ### **If Current URLs Work:** - **Keep them for now** to avoid breaking existing functionality - **Update after marketplace approval** to avoid certification delays - **Focus on completing and submitting the offer** ### **If Current URLs Don't Work:** - **Update to lifecoach-121.com URLs** immediately - **Note:** You'll need to implement these endpoints post-launch - **Microsoft allows updates** after initial certification --- ## **Immediate Action Plan** ### **Quick Test (5 minutes):** 1. **Open browser tabs:** - `https://life-app-ozjafmtimm6os.bravepond-4b4b0778.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/marketplace/landing` - `https://life-app-ozjafmtimm6os.bravepond-4b4b0778.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/marketplace/webhook` 2. **Check if they load:** - **If they work:** Keep current URLs for now - **If they don't work:** Update to lifecoach-121.com URLs ### **Decision Matrix:** - **Current URLs work** → Keep them, submit offer, update later - **Current URLs broken** → Update to lifecoach-121.com, implement later - **Want professional branding** → Update to lifecoach-121.com now --- ## **My Strong Recommendation** ### **For Launch Day Success:** 1. **Keep current Azure Container Apps URLs** if they're working 2. **Submit your marketplace offer** with existing configuration 3. **Get approved first** (don't risk delays with URL changes) 4. **Update to lifecoach-121.com** after approval ### **Post-Launch Enhancement:** - Implement professional landing page at lifecoach-121.com - Build webhook handler for subscription management - Migrate from Azure Container Apps to your preferred architecture - Update marketplace configuration with new URLs --- ## **Action Decision** **Choose your path:** ### **Path A: Keep Current (Safest for Launch)** - Don't change anything - Submit offer immediately - Focus on getting approved - Enhance later ### **Path B: Update to Professional Domain** - Change to lifecoach-121.com URLs - Use your main tenant and app IDs - Professional branding from day one - Need to implement endpoints **What do those Azure Container Apps URLs show when you visit them?** That will determine the best approach!
