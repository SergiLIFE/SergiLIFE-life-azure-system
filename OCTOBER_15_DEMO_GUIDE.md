Click "Share Screen" in Teams 2. Select "Browser Window" (not full screen) 3. Choose the window with L.I.F.E. dashboard 4. Make sure audio is shared if dashboard has sounds ### No Dashboard Found: 1. **Check E: Drive**: Make sure external drive is connected 2. **Search Computer**: Search for "L.I.F.E. Platform" files 3. **Alternative Location**: Look in Downloads or Documents folders --- ## DEMO SUCCESS TIPS ### Engagement Strategies: - Start with exciting metrics: "84.3% accuracy, 12.4ms processing!" - Ask audience questions: "Who has worked with EEG data before?" - Demonstrate AI interaction live - Show real-time updates and processing ### Technical Presentation: - Keep browser at 100% zoom for clarity - Use fullscreen mode for maximum visibility - Have backup browser tab ready - Test all interactive features beforehand ### Professional Impact: - Emphasize clinical-grade standards - Highlight PhysioNet dataset integration - Discuss collaboration opportunities - Share vision for neuroscience advancement --- ## EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN If technical issues occur: ### Plan A: Static Presentation - Take screenshots of key dashboard sections - Create PowerPoint with main features - Focus on explaining concepts vs. live demo ### Plan B: Video Demo - Record dashboard interaction beforehand - Play video during presentation - Narrate over pre-recorded demonstration ### Plan C: Collaborative Discussion - Turn into interactive Q&A session - Discuss neuroplasticity research applications - Share vision and get colleague input - Plan follow-up individual demos --- ## OCTOBER 15, 2025 - YOU'RE READY! **Your L.I.F.E.
