## 🚨 CONTINGENCY PLANS

### **If Campaign Manager Fails:**
**Backup: Manual Email Campaign**
1. Export institution list from `tracking_data/`
2. Use Outlook/Gmail with mail merge
3. Send in batches of 100 to avoid spam filters
4. Track responses manually in spreadsheet

### **If Marketplace Goes Down:**
**Backup Actions:**
1. Contact Azure Support immediately
2. Post status update on social media
3. Direct customers to direct contact (sergi@lifecoach-121.com)
4. Offer to process subscriptions manually
5. Extend launch offer period to compensate

### **If Infrastructure Can't Handle Load:**
**Scaling Plan:**
1. Enable aggressive auto-scaling in Azure Functions
2. Increase App Service Plan tier temporarily
3. Add read replicas for databases
4. Enable CDN for static content
5. Implement queue system for peak traffic

### **If Negative Feedback/Reviews:**
**Response Strategy:**
1. Respond within 1 hour (acknowledge concern)
2. Investigate issue immediately
3. Offer direct resolution (call, meeting, refund if needed)
4. Fix underlying issue if valid
5. Follow up to confirm resolution
6. Request updated review once resolved
