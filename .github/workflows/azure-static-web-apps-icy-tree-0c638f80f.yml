# DISABLED: Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD - No Static Web App resource exists
# 
# This workflow was failing because no Azure Static Web App resource exists in your subscriptions.
# The error was: "No matching Static Web App was found or the api key was invalid"
#
# To re-enable:
# 1. Create an Azure Static Web App resource
# 2. Get the deployment token from the resource
# 3. Add AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_ICY_TREE_0C638F80F to GitHub secrets
# 4. Uncomment the workflow below
