# Use Existing App Service - Skip Static Web Apps

## Current Status
✅ **App Service is WORKING**: lifecoach-121.com is successfully serving your L.I.F.E. Platform
❌ **Static Web Apps having issues**: Multiple deployment problems, CLI errors

## Why App Service is Better Choice Right Now

## Recommendation: Stick with App Service

### Update DNS to Point to App Service
Instead of fighting with Static Web Apps, configure your domain to use the working App Service:

1. **Keep lifecoach-121.com pointing to App Service**
2. **Update marketing materials to use lifecoach-121.com**
3. **Skip Static Web Apps entirely**

### Benefits
- ✅ **Zero downtime** - already working
