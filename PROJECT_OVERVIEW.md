## Azure Ecosystem Review Status

### Attempted Actions

1. **Resource Inventory Query**: Attempted to retrieve comprehensive Azure resource information
2. **Subscription Analysis**: Tried to map subscription resources, resource groups, and governance policies
3. **Best Practices Retrieval**: Successfully gathered Azure governance and deployment guidelines

### Current Challenges

#### 1. Access Permissions (Primary Blocker)

**Status**: ❌ **BLOCKED**  
**Issue**: Azure Resource Graph query returned 403 Forbidden

```text
Error: AccessDenied
Timestamp: 2025-09-09T12:00:05.0204871Z
CorrelationId: 9ba63d66-2721-4172-9e71-96bd35ad27a8
Message: Access is denied to the requested resource. The user might not have enough permission.
```

**Root Cause**: Insufficient permissions to query Azure Resource Graph for subscription-wide resource inventory.

**Required Permissions**:

- `Reader` role on subscription or resource groups
- `Resource Graph Reader` role for Azure Resource Graph queries
- Potentially `Monitoring Reader` for metrics and diagnostics

#### 2. Logic Apps Extension Issues (RESOLVED ✅)

**Previous Issue**: Azure Logic Apps Standard extension dependency installation failing with EPERM errors
**Solution Applied**: Configured VS Code settings to redirect dependency installation to correct user profile path
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Azure Best Practices Framework

### Security & Authentication

- ✅ **Managed Identity**: Prefer managed identity over key-based authentication
- ✅ **Key Vault Integration**: Never hardcode credentials
- ✅ **Least Privilege**: Implement RBAC with minimal required permissions
- ✅ **Encryption**: Enable encryption in transit and at rest

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- ✅ **Bicep Preferred**: Use Bicep templates over PowerShell/CLI scripts
- ✅ **File Organization**: Place Bicep files under `infra/` directory
- ✅ **Resource Separation**: Separate concerns by resource type and environment
- ✅ **Version Control**: All IaC files in source control with proper branching

### Deployment Strategy

- ✅ **Azure Developer CLI**: Prefer `azd` commands over individual `az` commands
- ✅ **Preview Deployments**: Always use `--preview` or `what-if` before deployment
- ✅ **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/staging/production environments
- ✅ **Continuous Deployment**: Implement proper CI/CD pipelines

### Performance & Reliability

- ✅ **Connection Pooling**: Implement for database connections
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- ✅ **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and telemetry

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

#### 1. Resolve Azure Access Permissions

```powershell
# Check current user and role assignments
az account show
az role assignment list --assignee $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv)

# Request necessary permissions from Azure administrator
# Required roles:
# - Reader (subscription or resource group level)
# - Resource Graph Reader
```

#### 2. Manual Resource Inventory (Fallback)

If permissions cannot be granted immediately, collect resource information manually:

```powershell
# Basic subscription information
az account show --output table

# List all resource groups
az group list --output table

# List resources by type
az resource list --query "[].{Name:name, Type:type, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Location:location}" --output table

# List storage accounts
az storage account list --output table

# List function apps
az functionapp list --output table

# List logic apps
az logic workflow list --output table
```

#### 3. Document Current Azure Estate

Create detailed inventory including:

- **Subscription Details**: Name, ID, tenant, quotas
- **Resource Groups**: Organization, naming conventions, purpose
- **Compute Resources**: VMs, Function Apps, Logic Apps, Container Instances
- **Storage Resources**: Storage accounts, blob containers, file shares
- **Networking**: VNets, subnets, NSGs, load balancers
- **Security**: Key Vaults, managed identities, RBAC assignments
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights, Log Analytics workspaces

### Short-term Goals (2-4 weeks)

#### 1. Infrastructure Standardization

- ✅ Create standardized Bicep templates for L.I.F.E. Platform components
