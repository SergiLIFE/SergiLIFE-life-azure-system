Subject: URGENT - Support Request 2510100050000037 - Contradictory Credit Information Requires Immediate Clarification

Dear Shalini,

I am writing to request immediate clarification regarding contradictory information I have received about my Microsoft for Startups credit status over the past two days.

## CRITICAL CONTRADICTION IDENTIFIED

**Your Response on October 9, 2025 (Case ID: 2506280040000796):**
- Total Allocation: $150,000 Microsoft for Startups credits
- Recent Charges: ¬£14,253.27 on 07/11/2025
- **Remaining Balance: $80,747.26 available credits**
- Status: Subscription converted from pay-as-you-go to sponsorship

**Your Response Today, October 10, 2025:**
- **"Full 80,000 credits were used"** (80,000 vs previously stated 150,000?)
- **Account canceled on September 29, 2025**
- **Converted to Pay-As-You-Go on September 29, 2025**
- Subscription ID: 5c88cef6-f243-497d-98af-6c6086d575ca

## SPECIFIC DISCREPANCIES REQUIRING CLARIFICATION

1. **Total Credit Allocation**:
   - October 9: You confirmed $150,000 total allocation
   - October 10: You mention "80,000 credits"
   - **QUESTION**: What is the actual total credit allocation?

2. **Account Status Timeline**:
   - October 9: You reported charges on 07/11/2025 (November 7, 2025)
   - October 10: You state account was canceled on September 29, 2025
   - **QUESTION**: How can charges occur on November 7 if account was canceled on September 29?

3. **Remaining Balance**:
   - October 9: You confirmed $80,747.26 remaining credits
   - October 10: You state "full credits were used"
   - **QUESTION**: Do I have remaining credits or not?

4. **Account Conversion Date**:
   - October 9: You indicated recent conversion to sponsorship
   - October 10: You state conversion occurred on September 29, 2025
   - **QUESTION**: When did the actual conversion occur?

## REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION

This contradictory information is causing significant confusion for business planning purposes. I need definitive answers to:

1. **What is my actual current credit balance?**
2. **What is my actual account status as of October 10, 2025?**
3. **Are there multiple subscription IDs that may be causing confusion?**
4. **Which of your two responses contains accurate information?**

## BUSINESS IMPACT

The L.I.F.E. Platform is currently operational on Azure with:
- 387 institutions engaged in active campaigns
- 23 demo requests from major institutions  
- 12 active trials in progress
- $345,000 Q4 2025 revenue target

**Accurate credit information is critical** for business continuity and scaling decisions.

## REQUESTED ACTIONS

**Immediate Requirements**:
1. **Definitive credit balance statement** as of October 10, 2025
2. **Explanation of the discrepancies** between your October 9 and October 10 responses
3. **Verification of subscription ID** and account status
4. **Escalation to supervisor** if necessary to resolve contradictory information

**Documentation Request**: 
Please provide official documentation showing:
- Current credit balance
- Account status and conversion timeline
- All subscription IDs associated with my Microsoft for Startups account

## URGENCY JUSTIFICATION

With contradictory information provided on consecutive days, I cannot make informed business decisions regarding:
- Infrastructure scaling for Q4 2025 customer growth
- Resource allocation for the 23 pending institutional demos
- Budget planning for international expansion

**This requires immediate resolution** to avoid disruption to active customer engagements and business operations.

I look forward to your urgent clarification and resolution of these discrepancies.

Best regards,

**Sergio Paya Borrull**  
Founder & Chief Technology Officer  
L.I.F.E. Platform (Learning Individually from Experience)
