# L.I.F.E Platform Scaling Strategy

## Horizontal Scaling

### Container Apps Scaling
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
- Queue-based scaling for processing
- Geographic distribution for global reach

### Database Scaling
- Read replicas for improved performance
- Sharding for large datasets
- Caching layer for frequent queries

## Vertical Scaling

### Compute Resources
- CPU optimization for EEG processing
- Memory scaling for large neural networks
- GPU acceleration for quantum processing

### Storage Optimization
- Hot/cold storage tiers
- Data compression strategies
- Archive policies for historical data

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Goals
- Real-time EEG processing: < 100ms
- Learning adaptation: < 200ms
- Dashboard updates: < 500ms
- API responses: < 300ms

### Throughput Targets
- Concurrent users: 2000+
- EEG samples/sec: 200,000+
- Learning sessions/hour: 10,000+
- Data processing: 1TB/day
