# GitHub Actions Deployment Fix - October 26, 2025 ## Issue Fixed **Problem:** GitHub Actions workflow failing with 404 error **Error:** "Failed to deploy web package to App Service. Not Found (CODE: 404)" **Target:** `life-functions-app-prod.azurewebsites.net` ## Root Cause The Azure deployment workflow (`azure-deploy-fixed-oct26.yml`) was trying to deploy to an Azure App Service (`life-functions-app-prod`) that doesn't exist in your subscription. According to your architecture: - **Web Interface:** Working at `https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/...` - **Logic App:** `life-platform-campaign-launcher` deployed and operational - **App Service:** `life-functions-app-prod` does NOT exist ## Solution Applied **Disabled automatic deployment triggers** in `azure-deploy-fixed-oct26.yml`: ```yaml on: # Disabled - Platform uses external web interface # push: # branches: [main] # pull_request: # branches: [main] workflow_dispatch: # Can still run manually if needed ``` ## Impact **Before:** - Every push to main triggered deployment - Deployment failed with 404 error - Workflow marked as failed **After:** - No automatic deployment on push - Workflow can still be run manually via workflow_dispatch - All commits will succeed without deployment errors ## Other Active Workflows These workflows remain active and will continue to run on push: - `github-pages.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment (working) - `test.yml` / `test-fixed.yml` - Test suites - `security-scan.yml` - Security scanning - `campaign-launcher.yml` - Campaign automation - `nakedai-unbreakable-backup.yml` - Backup system ## Platform Status **Operational Components:** - Web Interface (External S3 URL) - Logic App (Azure) - Campaign Manager - GitHub Repository **Non-Operational (Not Required):** - ️ Azure App Service deployment (disabled, not needed) - ️ Azure Functions (not deployed, web interface used instead) ## Next Steps If you want to enable Azure App Service deployment in the future: 1. **Create the App Service:** ```bash az webapp create \ --name life-functions-app-prod \ --resource-group life-platform-prod \ --plan life-platform-plan \ --runtime "PYTHON:3.11" ``` 2. **Re-enable workflow:** - Uncomment the `push:` and `pull_request:` triggers - Update app name if different 3. **Add AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret** to GitHub (if not already added) ## Verification After committing this fix: - All future commits will succeed - No more 404 deployment errors - Your web interface continues to work independently --- **Fixed:** October 26, 2025 **Issue:** GitHub Actions deployment 404 error **Status:** RESOLVED - Deployment workflow disabled **Impact:** Platform remains fully operational
