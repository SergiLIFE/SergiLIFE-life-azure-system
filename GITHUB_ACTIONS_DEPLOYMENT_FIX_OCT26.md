# GitHub Actions Deployment Fix - October 26, 2025

## 🚨 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** GitHub Actions workflow failing with 404 error  
**Error:** "Failed to deploy web package to App Service. Not Found (CODE: 404)"  
**Target:** `life-functions-app-prod.azurewebsites.net`  

## 🔍 Root Cause

The Azure deployment workflow (`azure-deploy-fixed-oct26.yml`) was trying to deploy to an Azure App Service (`life-functions-app-prod`) that doesn't exist in your subscription.

According to your architecture:
- ✅ **Web Interface:** Working at `https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/...`
- ✅ **Logic App:** `life-platform-campaign-launcher` deployed and operational
- ❌ **App Service:** `life-functions-app-prod` does NOT exist

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Disabled automatic deployment triggers** in `azure-deploy-fixed-oct26.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  # Disabled - Platform uses external web interface
  # push:
  #   branches: [main]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Can still run manually if needed
```

## 📊 Impact

**Before:**
- ❌ Every push to main triggered deployment
- ❌ Deployment failed with 404 error
- ❌ Workflow marked as failed

**After:**
- ✅ No automatic deployment on push
- ✅ Workflow can still be run manually via workflow_dispatch
- ✅ All commits will succeed without deployment errors

## 🎯 Other Active Workflows

These workflows remain active and will continue to run on push:
- ✅ `github-pages.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment (working)
- ✅ `test.yml` / `test-fixed.yml` - Test suites
- ✅ `security-scan.yml` - Security scanning
- ✅ `campaign-launcher.yml` - Campaign automation
- ✅ `nakedai-unbreakable-backup.yml` - Backup system

## 🚀 Platform Status

**Operational Components:**
- ✅ Web Interface (External S3 URL)
- ✅ Logic App (Azure)
- ✅ Campaign Manager
- ✅ GitHub Repository

**Non-Operational (Not Required):**
- ⚠️ Azure App Service deployment (disabled, not needed)
- ⚠️ Azure Functions (not deployed, web interface used instead)

## 📝 Next Steps

If you want to enable Azure App Service deployment in the future:

1. **Create the App Service:**
   ```bash
   az webapp create \
     --name life-functions-app-prod \
     --resource-group life-platform-prod \
     --plan life-platform-plan \
     --runtime "PYTHON:3.11"
   ```

2. **Re-enable workflow:**
   - Uncomment the `push:` and `pull_request:` triggers
   - Update app name if different

3. **Add AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret** to GitHub (if not already added)

## ✅ Verification

After committing this fix:
- All future commits will succeed
- No more 404 deployment errors
- Your web interface continues to work independently
