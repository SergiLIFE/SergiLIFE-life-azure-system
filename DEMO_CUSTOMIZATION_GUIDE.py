L.I.F.E. PLATFORM DEMO PRESENTER CHEAT SHEET
===========================================

BEFORE THE DEMO:
✓ Review questionnaire responses 2-3 participants at a time
✓ Identify primary field: Healthcare, Education, or Enterprise  
✓ Note top 3 challenges and demo focus areas
✓ Select appropriate demo scenario (8-15 minutes)
✓ Prepare tier recommendation

QUICK FIELD IDENTIFICATION:
🏥 HEALTHCARE: Hospital, Clinic, Medical → Focus on clinical outcomes, EHR integration, patient care
🎓 EDUCATION: K-12, University, Special Ed → Focus on learning outcomes, student progress, IEPs
🏢 ENTERPRISE: Corporate, Training → Focus on ROI, efficiency, employee development

DEMO FLOW TEMPLATE:
1. Personalized Opening (1 min): "Based on your [specialty], let's focus on..."
2. Core Feature Demo (3-5 min): Show most relevant capability
3. Integration/Workflow (2-3 min): How it fits their environment  
4. Success Metrics (1-2 min): ROI, outcomes, efficiency gains
5. Next Steps (1 min): Implementation timeline, tier recommendation

KEY MESSAGES BY FIELD:
🏥 Healthcare: "Improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, enhance clinical workflow"
🎓 Education: "Personalize learning, track progress, support every student's success"  
🏢 Enterprise: "Optimize training ROI, enhance employee performance, reduce costs"

PRICING QUICK REFERENCE:
• Basic ($99/month): Individual practitioners, small clinics
• Professional ($299/month): Mid-size organizations, most features
• Enterprise ($999/month): Large organizations, full capabilities, research features

COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES:
"Too expensive" → Show ROI calculation, start with free trial
"Too complex" → Emphasize ease of use, training support included
"Integration concerns" → Demonstrate API capabilities, existing integrations
"Data security" → Highlight Azure security, HIPAA compliance, encryption

CLOSING TECHNIQUES:
✓ "Based on your [specific need], I recommend [specific tier]"
✓ "Would you like to start with our [30-day/90-day] free trial?"
✓ "What would you need to see to move forward?"
✓ "Should we schedule an implementation planning session?"

FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS:
□ Send tier-specific pricing information
□ Provide relevant case studies
□ Schedule technical integration discussion
□ Connect with implementation team
□ Send free trial setup instructions
