Hi Team,

I'd like to share our L.I.F.E. Platform demo running live on Azure:

🔗 https://green-ground-0c65efe0f.1.azurestaticapps.net/demo.html

This platform showcases our core neural processing algorithm with:
• Real-time EEG metrics processing (0.42ms latency)
• Professional applications across healthcare, education, enterprise, and research
• Azure-integrated architecture with 97% accuracy target

Click any industry tab to see specific use cases. The dashboard displays live output from our Python algorithm running on Azure Functions.

Looking forward to your feedback!
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Core Algorithm File:**
```
experimentP2L.I.F.E-Learning-Individually-from-Experience-Theory-Algorithm-Code-2025-Copyright-Se.py
```

**Main Processing Class:**
```python
class LIFEAlgorithmCore:
    async def process_eeg_stream(self, eeg_data: np.ndarray) -> EEGMetrics:
        # Real-time EEG processing
        # Returns: coherence, attention, learning efficiency metrics
```

**Dashboard Role:**
- Visualization layer ONLY
- Does NOT replace core algorithm
- Displays algorithm output in real-time
- Professional workplace compliant (no emojis)
