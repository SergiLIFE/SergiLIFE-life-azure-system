**Data Flow Architecture:**

- Container Apps receive L.I.F.E. algorithm processing requests and demonstrate 880x performance
- Azure Functions handle Microsoft executive outreach automation (LinkedIn, email)
- Azure OpenAI Service provides GPT-4 integration demonstrations
- Blob Storage stores demo results, executive presentation materials, and performance benchmarks
- Key Vault securely manages Microsoft executive contact information and API keys
- Application Insights and Monitor track executive engagement and system performance
- Storage Account uses Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) for high availability across containers

## **Recommended Azure Resources**

**Primary Application: SergiLIFE-life-azure-backup**
- Hosting Service Type: Azure Functions
- SKU: Consumption Plan (Y1) - Serverless, pay-per-execution model ideal for scheduled backup operations
- Configuration:
  - Language: Python 3.11
  - Runtime: Azure Functions v4
  - Environment Variables:
    - `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: stlifeplatformprod
    - `BACKUP_CONTAINER`: life-repository-backup
    - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com
    - `MARKETPLACE_OFFER_ID`: 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb

**Dependencies Resources**:

1. **Azure Storage Account**
   - SKU: Standard_ZRS (Zone-redundant storage)
   - Service Type: StorageV2 with Hot access tier
   - Connection Type: Managed Identity with Storage Blob Data Contributor role
   - Containers: life-repository-backup, life-repository-versions, life-metadata

2. **Azure Key Vault**
   - SKU: Standard
   - Service Type: Key Vault with RBAC authorization
   - Connection Type: Managed Identity
   - Environment Variables: Key Vault URL for secure credential access

3. **Logic Apps**

- RBAC Authorization: Key Vault uses RBAC instead of access policies
- TLS 1.2: Enforced across all services with HTTPS-only traffic

## **Execution Steps**

> **Below are the steps for Copilot to follow; ask Copilot to update or execute this plan.**

### 1. Provision Azure Infrastructure And Deploy the Application:

1. **Get IaC Rules**: Use `iac-rules-get` tool to obtain Infrastructure as Code best practices
2. **Validate Existing Bicep**: Check `infra/backup-infrastructure.bicep` for errors using `get_errors` tool
3. **Pre-deployment Validation**: Run `azd provision --preview` to validate deployment before execution
4. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Execute `azd up` to provision resources and deploy the Function App
5. **Verify Deployment**: Check deployment output to ensure all resources are created successfully
6. **Application Validation**: Use `azd-app-log-get` tool to verify Function App is running correctly

### 2. Performance Monitoring Integration:

1. **Connect Performance Analyzer**: Integrate existing `performance_analyzer.py` with Application Insights
2. **Configure Metrics**: Set up custom metrics for backup operations and repository synchronization
3. **Create Dashboards**: Configure Application Insights dashboards for backup monitoring
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Create alerts for backup failures and performance degradation

### 3. Testing and Validation:

1. **Backup System Test**: Trigger manual backup to verify end-to-end functionality
2. **Schedule Validation**: Confirm Logic App triggers Function App correctly
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify backup operations meet performance thresholds
4. **Recovery Testing**: Test file recovery from backup containers

### 4. Summary:

1. **Deployment Summary**: Document all provisioned resources and configuration
2. **Save Results**: Create `.azure/summary.copilotmd` with deployment details and architecture diagram
3. **Performance Integration**: Document Performance Analyzer integration with backup monitoring
4. **Next Steps**: Provide recommendations for ongoing monitoring and optimization

## **Integration Points**

- **Performance Analyzer**: Existing `performance_analyzer.py` will monitor backup operations
- **L.I.F.E. Platform**: Repository backup supports main platform operations
- **Azure Marketplace**: Backup infrastructure supports marketplace offer `9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb`
- **Production Environment**: Subscription `5c88cef6-f243-497d-98af-6c6086d575ca` in East US 2 region
