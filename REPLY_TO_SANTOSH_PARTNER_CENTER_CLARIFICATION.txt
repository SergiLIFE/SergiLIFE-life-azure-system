Azure Tenant:ubject: RE: Partner Center Access Clarification + TPD Services Request

Dear Santosh,

Thank you for the excellent meeting today and for the comprehensive follow-up email. I wanted to clarify an important point and request next steps.

**URGENT: Account Access & Authentication Issues:**

You are correct that I'm experiencing Partner Center access issues. Here's the complete situation:

**Current Account Status:**
- **Partner Center Account:** Info@lifecoach121.com - I CAN login but DON'T WANT to use this account due to:
  - Account experienced technical issues during certification
  - Ongoing technical challenges with this account
  - Not where my production work lives
  
- **Azure Subscription Account:** sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com - This is where ALL my production infrastructure and work lives, but:
  - I CANNOT login due to authentication/MFA issues
  - Awaiting Microsoft tech support resolution
  - This is the account I need to use going forward

**The Critical Issue:**
My L.I.F.E Platform offer is live on Azure Marketplace (Offer ID: 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb), but all my production work is on the sergiomiguelpaya account which I cannot currently access:
1. Partner Center (Info@lifecoach121.com) - accessible but has ongoing technical issues, prefer not to use
2. Azure Portal/Subscription (sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com) - this is where everything is, but cannot access due to authentication issues

**What I Need Urgently:**
- Help from Microsoft tech support to resolve authentication issues on sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com
- Guidance on getting Partner Center access connected to my sergiomiguelpaya account (not the Info@lifecoach121.com account)
- Clarification on how to properly set up everything under one unified account (sergiomiguelpaya) for marketplace certification and co-sell

**Request for TPD Services:**

I'm very interested in the Technical Presales and Deployment (TPD) services you mentioned. Specifically, I would like consultation on:

1. **Co-Sell Readiness Assessment:** Evaluating our offer for co-sell ready status with Microsoft field sales
2. **Azure Consumption Optimization:** Maximizing Azure service usage in our platform architecture
3. **Go-to-Market Strategy:** Guidance on enterprise customer acquisition through Microsoft channels
4. **Technical Architecture Review:** Validation of our production Azure deployment for scale

**Current Status:**
- Live Azure Marketplace offer (published Oct 2, 2025)
- Production infrastructure: Azure Functions, Storage, Service Bus, Key Vault, Container Apps
- Subscription: Microsoft Azure Sponsorship (5c88cef6-f243-497d-98af-6c6086d575ca)
- Target market: 1,720 institutions (education, healthcare, enterprise)
- Q4 2025 revenue target: $345K

**Next Steps Request:**

1. How do I formally request TPD consultation services?
2. What is the timeline for TPD engagement?
3. Can you connect me with the appropriate Microsoft account team for co-sell discussions?
4. Are there specific requirements for co-sell ready status I should prepare?

**October 7 Launch Campaign:**

We're launching a major marketing campaign on October 7, 2025 (4 days from now) targeting our 1,720 institution database. Microsoft co-sell support would significantly accelerate our enterprise customer acquisition.

Thank you again for your time and guidance today. I look forward to leveraging TPD services and working with Microsoft to maximize this partnership opportunity.
