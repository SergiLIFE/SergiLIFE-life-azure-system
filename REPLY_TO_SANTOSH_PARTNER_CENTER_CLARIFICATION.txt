I wanted to clarify an important point and request next steps. **URGENT: Account Access & Authentication Issues:** You are correct that I'm experiencing Partner Center access issues. Here's the complete situation: **Current Account Status:** - **Partner Center Account:** Info@lifecoach121.com - I CAN login but DON'T WANT to use this account due to: - Account experienced technical issues during certification - Ongoing technical challenges with this account - Not where my production work lives - **Azure Subscription Account:** sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com - This is where ALL my production infrastructure and work lives, but: - I CANNOT login due to authentication/MFA issues - Awaiting Microsoft tech support resolution - This is the account I need to use going forward **The Critical Issue:** My L.I.F.E Platform offer is live on Azure Marketplace (Offer ID: 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb), but all my production work is on the sergiomiguelpaya account which I cannot currently access: 1. Partner Center (Info@lifecoach121.com) - accessible but has ongoing technical issues, prefer not to use 2. Azure Portal/Subscription (sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com) - this is where everything is, but cannot access due to authentication issues **What I Need Urgently:** - Help from Microsoft tech support to resolve authentication issues on sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com - Guidance on getting Partner Center access connected to my sergiomiguelpaya account (not the Info@lifecoach121.com account) - Clarification on how to properly set up everything under one unified account (sergiomiguelpaya) for marketplace certification and co-sell **Request for TPD Services:** I'm very interested in the Technical Presales and Deployment (TPD) services you mentioned. Specifically, I would like consultation on: 1. **Co-Sell Readiness Assessment:** Evaluating our offer for co-sell ready status with Microsoft field sales 2. **Azure Consumption Optimization:** Maximizing Azure service usage in our platform architecture 3. **Go-to-Market Strategy:** Guidance on enterprise customer acquisition through Microsoft channels 4. **Technical Architecture Review:** Validation of our production Azure deployment for scale **Current Status:** - Live Azure Marketplace offer (published Oct 2, 2025) - Production infrastructure: Azure Functions, Storage, Service Bus, Key Vault, Container Apps - Subscription: Microsoft Azure Sponsorship (5c88cef6-f243-497d-98af-6c6086d575ca) - Target market: 1,720 institutions (education, healthcare, enterprise) - Q4 2025 revenue target: $345K **Next Steps Request:** 1. How do I formally request TPD consultation services? 2. What is the timeline for TPD engagement? 3. Can you connect me with the appropriate Microsoft account team for co-sell discussions? 4. Are there specific requirements for co-sell ready status I should prepare? **October 7 Launch Campaign:** We're launching a major marketing campaign on October 7, 2025 (4 days from now) targeting our 1,720 institution database. Microsoft co-sell support would significantly accelerate our enterprise customer acquisition. Thank you again for your time and guidance today. I look forward to leveraging TPD services and working with Microsoft to maximize this partnership opportunity.
