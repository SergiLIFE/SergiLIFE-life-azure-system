- **Lifecycle Policies**:
  - Raw data: 90-day retention
  - Processed data: 1-year retention
  - Results: 7-year retention (compliance)
  - Logs: 3-year retention

### Security Implementation

#### Encryption at Rest
- All data encrypted using Azure Storage encryption
- Key Vault integration for custom keys
- Transparent data encryption (TDE) for databases

#### Network Security
- Virtual Network integration
- Private endpoints for storage
- Firewall rules and IP restrictions

#### Identity Management
