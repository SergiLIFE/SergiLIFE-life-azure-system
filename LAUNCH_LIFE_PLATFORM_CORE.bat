echo SYSTEM FEATURES:
echo - Real-time EEG processing with complete experimentP2L algorithm
echo - Learning Stages: ACQUISITION, CONSOLIDATION, RETRIEVAL, ADAPTATION
echo - Neural States: RESTING, FOCUSED, LEARNING, PROCESSING, CONSOLIDATING
echo - 100-cycle system testing
echo - Continuous neural processing
echo - Live metrics and performance tracking
echo.
echo The algorithm IS the platform. All processing is L.I.F.E-driven.
