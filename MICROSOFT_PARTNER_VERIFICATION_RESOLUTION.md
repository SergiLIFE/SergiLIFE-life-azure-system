I am submitting the following clarifications:

1. BUSINESS STRUCTURE: I operate as a sole proprietor under "SergiLIFE Technologies" with DBA "L.I.F.E Platform"

2. DOMAIN OWNERSHIP: lifecoach-121.com is my primary business domain for the L.I.F.E Platform neuroadaptive learning solution

3. AZURE MARKETPLACE: I am launching Offer ID 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb on September 27, 2025

2. **Individual Account** conversion = Immediate approval
3. **Direct Microsoft Support** call = Same-day resolution
