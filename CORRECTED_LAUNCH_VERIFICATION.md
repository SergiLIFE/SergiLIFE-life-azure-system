- ‚úÖ Access analytics and revenue reports
- ‚úÖ Manage account verification settings

### **Step 3: Check Offer Status in Correct Account**

## üîß **Account Verification Context**

### **Why Verification May Be Pending:**

1. **Microsoft Account Domain:**
   - Your Partner Center uses `@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com`
   - Your business domain is `lifecoach-121.com`
   - Microsoft may need to verify the connection between these domains

2. **Azure Sponsorship Account:**
   - You're using Azure Sponsorship (MS-AZR-0036P)
   - This is typically for developers/students
   - May require additional business verification for commercial marketplace

### **Verification Resolution Path:**

1. **Establish Business Connection:**
   - Show that `lifecoach-121.com` is your legitimate business domain
   - Provide business registration linking your name to the domain
   - Document the connection between Microsoft account and business

2. **Account Type Clarification:**
   - Your Azure Sponsorship may need upgrade to commercial account
   - Or get exception for marketplace publishing under sponsorship

Subject: URGENT - Marketplace Offer Verification - Account Admin Access

Dear Microsoft Partner Support,

I am the Account Admin for Partner Center account sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com and need immediate assistance with marketplace offer verification.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Partner Center Email: sergiomiguelpaya@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com
- Azure Subscription: 5c88cef6-f243-497d-98af-6c6086d575ca
- Directory: Sergio Paya Borrull (lifecoach-121.com)
- Role: Account Admin
- Offer Type: Azure Sponsorship (MS-AZR-0036P)

MARKETPLACE OFFER:
- Offer ID: 9a600d96-fe1e-420b-902a-a0c42c561adb

BUSINESS DETAILS:

- Business Domain: lifecoach-121.com

ISSUE:
My marketplace offer is not live despite being launch day. I suspect the verification issue is related to the connection between my Microsoft account domain (@sergiomiguelpayaborrullmsn.onmicrosoft.com) and my business domain (lifecoach-121.com).

REQUEST:
1. Immediate verification of my account status
2. Clarification on Azure Sponsorship account compatibility with marketplace

4. Guidance on any additional documentation needed

This is time-sensitive as today is our planned launch date.
