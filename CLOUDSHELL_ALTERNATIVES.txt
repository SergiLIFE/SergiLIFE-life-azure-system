# ===============================================
# ALTERNATIVE CLOUD SHELL SOLUTIONS
# October 11, 2025 - Multiple Testing Options
# ===============================================

# OPTION 1: Use your live Azure Static Web App (Easiest!)
# Your platform is already deployed and working at:
# https://green-ground-0c65efe0f.1.azurestaticapps.net
# Just open this URL in any browser - all interactive elements work!

# OPTION 2: Local Testing (Most Reliable)
# On your Windows machine, open Command Prompt and run:
cd "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system"
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open: http://localhost:8080/LIFE_PLATFORM_INTERACTIVE_LAUNCH_DEMO.html

# OPTION 3: Direct Browser Opening (Simplest!)
# Navigate to your demo file and double-click it:
# "C:\Users\Sergio Paya Borrull\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\.vscode\New folder\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\SergiLIFE-life-azure-system\LIFE_PLATFORM_INTERACTIVE_LAUNCH_DEMO.html"
# It will open in your default browser with full interactivity!

# OPTION 4: VS Code Simple Browser (Current Environment)
# In VS Code, use Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Simple Browser"
# Then enter the file path to preview your demo

# OPTION 5: Azure Portal Cloud Shell Alternative
# Instead of shell.azure.com, try:
# portal.azure.com -> Click Cloud Shell icon in top bar
# This may give you access to classic experience

# ===============================================
